## My Process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS
-   Flexbox
-   Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JS
-   Vite

### What I learned

I recently tried using `clamp` for creating responsive HTML instead of using media queries. At first, I found it overwhelming to understand how the formula for getting the preferred value for `clamp`. However, I found an online calculator that helped me speed up the process. I then decided to learn the basics of Vite, a build tool and used it for my project because it's faster and easier to learn compared to other build tools. I plan on learning Webpack in the future once I become more comfortable using build tools.

## Setup

To run this project, clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oshudev/sunnyside-landing-page.git
$ cd sunnyside-landing-page
$ pnpm install
```

Start dev server and watch assets for changes:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

_(optional)_ Start a local web server and locally preview the production build:

```bash
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm run preview
```
